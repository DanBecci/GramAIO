This is a instagram bot. This bot can perform functions such as following, liking, and commenting on user's posts by hashtag or username search. The bot is
in beta and will be finished later this week. Most of the bot's functions work currently so I am releasing this for the time being. You are free to download and
experiment with my code or build the current version yourself. Make sure to include citation (Source code by slash#1995 on Discord). Make sure you also have Google Chrome installed on your system.

Currently, there is still work to be done to the comment and username tag modules. I also plan on condensing tags to one section at some point. These changes will be coming 3/20/2022.

Additionally, this project will be updated often, eventually there will be auto-update implemented but for now, refer to this page for all updates

Clone this project: git clone https://github.com/SlashRobotics/GramAIO

Latest Update: Added further functionality to the 'USERS' module, implemented unfollow module, small performance tweaks. There is stil work to be done currently.

It looks like there is a couple false positives. This is likely due to the file not being signed.
